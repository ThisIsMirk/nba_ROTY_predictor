Machine learning algorithms:
Decision Tree
KNN
SVM
---------------
Classification vs Clustering 


- Tell the algorithm importance of ranking numbers 1 to 5, which in this case is categories. The categories having descending values of importance 1 to 5. 
 (watch youtube video) Normalize ranking column so that 1 is greater than 5. 


- How does it measure the importance of each feature and how it impacts the placement of the players in each ranking? 
- Measure importance of each feature and then give each feature a weightage depending on the importance
- We test this algorithm with the test data using the weighted features and see what it predicts -->
- The algorithm should give each player from the current rookies list a ranking out of the total number of players based on the calculations done by the algorithm
using the weightage factor. This calculation is done for each player and in the end we can sort this list to find out the rookie of the year. 


Measure feature importance:
- F1 score, precision, recall, confusion matrix
- feature_importances_ attribute for Random Forests
- SHAP
