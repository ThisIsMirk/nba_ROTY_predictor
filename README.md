## NBA Rookie of the Year Prediction

# Overview
This repository contains a project that predicts the NBA Rookie of the Year using various technologies and data sources, including Python machine learning models, Excel for data preprocessing, and Python web scraping with BeautifulSoup for data collection.

# Technologies Used:
    - Python: Used for data scraping, data preprocessing, and machine learning.
    - BeautifulSoup: Used for web scraping NBA player statistics.
    - Excel: Used for data cleaning and preprocessing.
    - Power BI: Used for data visualization and creating interactive reports.
    - Visual Studio: Used for development and documenting code.
    - Scikit-Learn: Used for machine learning and model evaluation.

# Project Structure
    - data/: Contains the raw and preprocessed data files.
    - models/: Stores the trained machine learning models.
    - scripts/: Python scripts for data scraping and other utilities.
    - reports/: Interactive reports and visualizations created with Power BI.
    - README.md: This README file.

# Model Training and Evaluation
    - The script uses a Random Forest classifier to predict the NBA Rookie of the year. 
    - Model accuracy is evaluated on a test set, and the results are printed to the console.

# Findings & Challenges
Throughout working in this project, we were faced with a few challenges and hurdles such as incomplete data, outliers, and various  code breaks. 
- For incomplete data, we had to import information from different key sources to fill in our missing gaps.
- For the outliers, we were able to
